        <p>Rukula was created in 2014 to offer credit to overlooked populations in an easy, transparent and safe manner. Over 5 years we have helped 40,000 low-income individuals obtain household necessities on credit through Rukulaâ€™s network of nationwide retailers.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">However, during these times, we understood that our customers needed a way to earn an income, and hence Rukula Shopping was born. The delivery team on this site are freelancers earning a daily income to provide for their families. Rukula is providing the systems and operations team to make sure they can do this.</p>

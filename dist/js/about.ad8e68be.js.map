Rukula Shopping only acts as an intermediary between the customer and the supplier for such products. These products may not be available (run out of stock) from time to time due to overselling by the suppliers, however, the product may be available for purchase on Rukula Shopping if the supplier has not promptly informed us of the fact that the product is unavailable for them to supply us. In such circumstances, Rukula Shopping.lk does not accept any liability whatsoever.</p>\r\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">In the event of stock unavailability, Rukula Shopping will inform the customer within 3 working days, [P1] and the payment can be refunded within 10 working days.</p>\r\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">The customer acknowledges and agrees that the only remedy available for the unavailability of a product is the refund of the money paid.</p>\r\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">Placement of an order including the payment of the order value by the Customer will be construed as an offer. When you place an order to purchase a product from us, you will receive an e-mail confirming receipt of your order and containing the details of your order (the \"Order Confirmation E-mail\"). The Order Confirmation E-mail is the acknowledgement that we have received your order and has been passed for processing and does not confirm acceptance of your offer to buy the product(s) ordered. We only accept your offer, when we have commenced delivery after the supplier has released the product.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                <h5 class=\"mt-4 mb-3\">Live Chat</h5>\r\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">By participating in this Live Chat, you agree to these terms and conditions applying to your use of the Live Chat.
